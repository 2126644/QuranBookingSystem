## Introduction of web application. 
## Objective of the enhancements. 

## Web Application Security Enhancements: 

### 1. Vulnerability Report - Based on OWASP ZAP scanning and states the risk and confidence levels of the found vulnerability. 
### 2. Web Security Fundamentals (Input Validation) 
* Implemented in `StudentAuthController`, `BookingController`, and other request handlers.
* Validates type, length, and format (whitelisting) using Laravelâ€™s validation layer in regex format.
* All user inputs are filtered using `Request::validate()`.

### 3. Web Security Fundamentals (Error Handling & Information Disclosure)
* Laravel default handler used (`Handler.php`) customized for user-friendly messages.
* Internal logs stored in `storage/logs/laravel.log`; no sensitive error output shown to users.
  
### 4. Authentication (Password Storage) 
* Stored using Argon2id with additional manual salting (`hashing.php`, `User.php`).
* `.env: HASH_DRIVER=argon`
* Example: `Hash::make($salt . $password)`.

### 5. Authentication (Password Policies) 
* Enforced in `PasswordValidationRules.php`.
* Minimum length, mixed characters, disallow known weak passwords.

### 6. Authentication (2 Factor Authentication) 
* Implemented via `TwoFactorController.php`, `TwoFactorCodeMail.php`
* One-time codes sent to verified emails using `Mail::to()->send(new TwoFactorCodeMail)`.

### 7. Authentication (Session Management) 
* Session tokens are regenerated on login and destroyed on logout.
* Cookies configured with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags.
  
### 8. Authorization (RBAC/(Role-Based Access Control)
* Defined in `Role.php`, enforced in `AdminController` & `StudentAuthController`.
* `middleware(`can:admin`) and `Gate` logic in `User.php` with roles like `admin`, `student`.

### 9. Authorization (Default Permissions)
* All routes protected via middleware.
* Least privilege by default using Laravel Policies.
* Admins and students have scoped abilities
* DB `.env` user: `quranbookingsystem_user` has minimal privileges
  
### 10. Browser Security Principles (Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention)
* All outputs escaped using Blade (`{{ }}`), no (`{{!! !!}}`) used..
* User-generated input never rendered as raw HTML.
  
### 11. Database Security Principles (SQL Injection Prevention)
* All queries use Laravel's Eloquent ORM or parameterized DB queries (`DB::table()->where(...)`).

### 12. Database Security Principles (Database Access Control)
* Application connects using `.env` credentials with minimum DB privileges.
  
### 13. File Security Principles (File Access Control)
* Blade files (`login.blade.php`, `register.blade.php`, `dashboard.blade.php`, etc.) are not publicly accessible.
* File paths never include direct user input.
* No file path injection (no user-defined file path usage)
